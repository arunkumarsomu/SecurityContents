		<Para>
			In the first Vorkosigan Saga entry after the resolution of Mile's
			non-military future in
			<title.cite>Memory</title.cite>
			, we find the little Vor Lord traveling to Komarr to help unravel the
			explosion of the terraforming soletta mirror array, after an
			unexplained collision with an inner-system ship. As Miles untangles
			the mystery with his usual panache, the book offers deeper pleasures.
			By the time Miles has solved the mystery and saved the Imperium
			again, the reader is longing for the next installment of the Saga.
		</Para>
		<Para>
			While this installment of the Saga is not as deeply characterized nor
			as engrossing as its immediate predecessor, it sets the groundwork
			for all the future volumes. One can only assume that the next
			adventures of Miles Vorkosigan will resemble
			<title.cite>Gaudy Night</title.cite>
			.
		</Para>
		<Para>
			In any case,
			<title.cite>Komarr</title.cite>
			offers it own pleasures, including fluent writing, plausible plot
			twists, and a range of new characters to act as foils to Miles. The
			use of alternating viewpoints underscores just how unrelable Miles'
			own viewpoint is, and offers an intriguing look at Miles from the
			perspective of a mature, unbiased observer. Among other things,
			<title.cite>Komarr</title.cite>
			contains a chilling (and entirely believable) depiction of a bad
			marriage, which sucks the honor out of its participants, one tedious
			moment at a time. Run,
			<shouting>do not walk</shouting>
			, and get a copy of this book. It is well worth the time an money you
			will invest in it.
