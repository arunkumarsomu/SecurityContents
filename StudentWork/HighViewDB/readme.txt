This HSQL database is run as a server by opening a command window on this folder and running start_highview.  Leave the DOS window open as that is the runtime output for the database server (status and error messages will appear in this window).    
 

The database itself is actually built at startup from the script file that is found in the data folder (this can be examined to see what values will be inserted at startup).
